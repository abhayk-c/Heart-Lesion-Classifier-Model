# Heart-Lesion-Classifier-Model
This is a jupyter notebook that trains a ML Model to "detect" lesions in angiogram heart scan medical images that could be used to "aid" in coronary heart disease detection. The model was trained on images using the CADICA data set, and leverages the resnet18 image model and employs a transfer learning approach.
